# Overall Assessment
# Your solution is correct and demonstrates a good approach to solving the problem. It's clear, concise, and handles the core requirements effectively. Here's my detailed feedback:

# Strengths
# Correctness: Your solution correctly identifies symmetric integers by checking the sum of digits in both halves.

# Readability: The code is clean and easy to understand with meaningful variable names.

# Efficiency: The solution has an optimal time complexity of O(N * D) where N is the range size and D is the average number of digits. This is reasonable for the problem constraints.

# Areas for Improvement
# Edge Case Handling: While not necessary for this problem, it's good practice to explicitly handle cases where low > high (though the range() function handles this gracefully).

# Early Digit Count Check: You could check the digit count before converting to string to potentially save some operations.

# Functional Approach: Consider using more functional programming constructs like map() for digit conversion.
