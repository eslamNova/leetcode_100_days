Problem: Check if a string is a prefix string formed by concatenating words from a list.

Given a string s and an array of strings words, determine if s is a prefix string of words.
A prefix string is formed by concatenating some number of words from the array in order.

Example:
    s = "iloveleetcode"
    words = ["i", "love", "leetcode", "apples"]
    Output: True
    Explanation: s can be made by concatenating "i", "love", and "leetcode".

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of string s
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the concatenated string

FAANG Interview Feedback:
1. Good: Initial check for first character match is a good optimization
2. Areas for Improvement:
   - Could use early termination when concatenated string exceeds target length
   - Consider using string builder pattern for better memory efficiency
   - Add input validation
   - Consider edge cases (empty string, empty words list)

class Solution:
    def isPrefixString(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> bool:

        if s[0] == words[0][0]:
            k = len(s)
            ss = ""
            for w in words:
                ss += w
                if len(ss) == k:
                    break
            if len(ss) == k:
                if s == ss:
                    return True
            return False
        else:
            return False

    
        
# Analysis of the solution:
"""
Code Analysis:
1. Approach:
   - The solution first checks if the first character of s matches the first character of the first word
   - If matched, it concatenates words until reaching the target length
   - Finally checks if the concatenated string equals the target string

2. Strengths:
   - Good initial optimization with first character check
   - Simple and readable implementation
   - Handles basic cases correctly
   - Early break when target length is reached

3. Time Complexity: O(n)
   - Where n is the length of string s
   - In worst case, we might need to concatenate all words

4. Space Complexity: O(n)
   - Space used by the concatenated string ss

5. Potential Optimizations (without changing the core logic):
   - Could add input validation for empty strings
   - Could add early termination if concatenated string exceeds target length
   - Could use string builder pattern for better memory efficiency
   - Could handle edge cases like empty input strings

Note: The current implementation is correct and efficient for most use cases.
The suggested optimizations would mainly help with edge cases and memory usage.
