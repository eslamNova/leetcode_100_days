"""
Feedback on the solution above:

1. Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) because for each position i, we're doing up to 3 flips, making it inefficient for large inputs.
2. The algorithm is using a greedy approach, which works for this problem but could be implemented more efficiently.
3. The debug prints are good for understanding the algorithm but can slow down execution.
4. The algorithm only checks the status of the first element (nums[i]) to decide if flipping is needed, which is correct
   for this greedy approach, but might be confusing without explanation.
5. The algorithm doesn't handle edge cases where array length is less than 3.

Below is a more optimized solution.
