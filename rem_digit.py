"""
Analysis of Original Solution:
1. Bug: The original solution doesn't check if the stack is empty before popping,
   which could lead to an IndexError if there are more digits than non-digit characters.
2. Style: The solution uses a non-descriptive variable name 'st' and 'i' when more meaningful
   names like 'stack' and 'char' would improve readability.
3. Efficiency: The solution is already optimal in terms of time and space complexity (O(n)).

Improvement Recommendations:
1. Always check if the stack is not empty before popping
2. Use more descriptive variable names
3. Consider using direct character iteration instead of indexing
4. Add proper documentation with time/space complexity analysis
5. Add error handling for edge cases
